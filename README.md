# pyghcn
#### Python library for the NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)
pyghcn is a Python 3 library for the NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) that includes:
 * retrieve lists of stations and their metadata and historical inventory
 * retrieve daily station data
 * extract series like `TMAX` from daily station data files
 * find stations within a given radius of a lat/long or POI
 * comprehensive unit tests with near-complete coverage

## What is GHCN?
[GHCN](), as excerpted from [its Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Historical_Climatology_Network), is:
> a database of temperature, precipitation and pressure records managed by the National Climatic Data Center, Arizona State University
> and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. The aggregate data are collected from many continuously reporting fixed stations
> at the Earth's surface and represent the input of approximately 6000 temperature stations, 7500 precipitation stations and 
> 2000 pressure stations.
